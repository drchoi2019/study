A pale complexion, fatigue, and weak limbs are also signs of Qi deficiency. Since there are no Yang deficiency symptoms like aversion to cold, cold limbs, or edema, Spleen Yang Deficiency is not the diagnosis.

The irregular menstruation can be seen as a result of Liver Qi Stagnation affecting blood circulation. A thin, white tongue coating is relatively normal, and a wiry pulse is a typical pulse presentation for Liver Qi Stagnation.

Poor appetite and limb weakness are symptoms of Spleen Qi deficiency. Feeling cold and having a weak, deep pulse indicate a lack of Yang Qi.

      "explanation": "A wiry pulse is a sign of a Liver pattern. It can be inferred that long-standing stagnant Liver Qi has transformed into Fire (Liver Fire), affecting the Stomach and Intestines (constipation, tenesmus). While Liver Qi Stagnation could be considered, the clear presence of Spleen/Stomach symptoms like poor appetite makes the diagnosis of Liver-Spleen Disharmony, where the functions of the Liver and Spleen/Stomach are uncoordinated, more fitting.

      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The combination of emotional factors (divorce, depression) and a wiry pulse is conclusive evidence of Liver Qi Stagnation. Epigastric pain, bloating, belching, and nausea are all symptoms arising from the impaired circulation of Qi. Goat-like stools are a very typical feature of constipation due to Qi stagnation; it is caused not by a weak intestinal propulsion but by the obstruction of Qi flow, leading to stool retention and excessive water absorption. While similar to Liver-Spleen Disharmony, in this case, the pain, bloating, and emotional issues are more prominent than digestive weakness, making the root cause, Liver Qi Stagnation, the primary pattern differentiation. Spleen Qi Deficiency would primarily involve fatigue and weakness with a weak pulse, and Lung Qi Deficiency would be dominated by respiratory symptoms."

Since the Liver and Gallbladder channels circulate through the genital area, Damp-Heat in the Lower Jiao is associated with the Liver and Gallbladder."

      "explanation": "Gradually progressing tinnitus, low back pain, and a weak chi pulse are the three major signs of Kidney Yin Deficiency. The Kidneys supply essence to the ears and lower back. When Kidney Yin is deficient, deficiency fire arises, causing a red tongue body, dry mouth, and five-palm heat.

      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Severe cold sensation, lower back/knee pain, systemic edema, and a weak chi pulse form a typical symptom cluster of Kidney Yang Deficiency. The Kidneys are the source of original Yang (Yuan Yang), govern the bones and lower back, and regulate fluid metabolism. The pale and swollen tongue body is also due to the lack of Yang Qi to warm and transform the body. The obesity and thick white coating indicate the generation of phlegm-damp due to water-damp retention. The history of angina and hypertension can be interpreted as 'Water Qi insulting the Heart' resulting from Kidney Yang Deficiency. Heart Yang Deficiency would focus on chest symptoms, Spleen Yang Deficiency would be dominated by digestive symptoms, and Kidney Yin Deficiency would present with deficiency-heat symptoms."

Liver Yang Rising is a pathology that occurs when Liver Yin is deficient and fails to control Liver Yang, causing Yang Qi to float upwards, with headache, dizziness, and tinnitus as the main symptoms.

The pain manifests more as a debilitating lower back and sacral pain, as if her back is breaking, rather than typical abdominal cramping. The patient feels hot, is thirsty, and dislikes warm compresses on the painful areas. She curls up when in pain. She has been diagnosed with endometriosis and has a history of asthma and allergic rhinitis. She also complains of dizziness and slight tinnitus.

This corresponds to Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency, where the yin fluids of both the Liver and Kidneys are depleted.

The dry skin and hair support the diagnosis of Blood Deficiency. The acid reflux and belching correspond to Stomach Qi Counterflow, where the Stomach Qi fails to descend and instead rebels upwards.

      "explanation": "The Heart governs sweat. Palpitations, thirst, irritability, a red tongue, and a rapid pulse are all signs of exuberant Fire in the Heart (Heart Fire). The Heart Fire forces the body fluids outwards, causing excessive sweating. The fact that the patient does not feel tired and appears energetic suggests an excess pattern rather than a deficiency pattern."

      "question": "A male patient in his 30s presents with a sudden onset of edema. The edema started on his eyelids and face and has gradually spread to his entire body. His urine output has decreased, and the urine is clear. He has an aversion to wind, fever, cough, and dyspnea. His tongue has a sticky white coating, and his pulse is floating and slippery. This belongs to which Lung Zang-fu pattern?",

        "D": "Damp-Phlegm Obstructing the Lungs"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Edema that starts on the face and is accompanied by exterior symptoms like aversion to wind, fever, and cough is characteristic of edema caused by an external pathogen. This corresponds to 'Wind-Water Overflowing,' where pathogenic Wind, accompanied by water-dampness, obstructs the Lung's function of regulating the water passages. In other words, the Lungs have been invaded by Wind-Dampness."

He has to strain very hard during defecation, is extremely thirsty, and has bad breath. His tongue has a thick, dry yellow coating, and his pulse is slippery and forceful. This belongs to which pattern?",

      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Severe thirst, bad breath, a dry yellow coating, and a slippery, forceful pulse are all characteristic features of heat-bind constipation, where heat has accumulated in the Stomach and Intestines. The heat in the Stomach and Intestines has dried up the body fluids, making the stool dry, and the turbid qi rises, causing bad breath. Constipation due to Yin fluid deficiency is more common in the elderly and presents with a deficiency pattern: a red tongue with little coating and a thready pulse."

      "question": "A 48-year-old obese man has been experiencing chest pain for 2 years. The pain began as a dull, oppressive sensation, triggered by fatigue or emotional stress. It has now changed to a stabbing nature, with symptoms including palpitations, a cough with thick white phlegm, and shortness of breath. Symptoms worsen with exercise, and his complexion is murky and dull. His head feels heavy as if wrapped in a bag, and he has a poor appetite and loose stools. He sweats easily after exercise. His tongue is dark red with purplish spots and a greasy white coating. His pulse is thin, choppy, and soft. How would you diagnose this?",

      },
      "answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The patient has Blood Stasis, as indicated by the stabbing chest pain and the purplish spots on his tongue. The thick white phlegm, heavy head, and greasy white coating suggest the presence of Phlegm. The worsening of symptoms with exercise, poor appetite, loose stools, easy sweating, and a choppy, soft pulse indicate Qi Deficiency. Therefore, this patient can be diagnosed with a complex pattern where Phlegm and Blood Stasis are obstructing the heart vessels, based on an underlying Qi Deficiency."

      "explanation": "Cough, dyspnea, and chest pain indicate a Lung problem. The red face, sensation of heat, thirst, red tongue with a yellow coating, and a large, rapid pulse are all signs of exuberant Heat. Since there is no mention of phlegm, it is most appropriate to diagnose this as a Lung Heat syndrome, where a pathogenic heat factor has directly invaded the Lungs and impaired their function, rather than Phlegm-Heat."

      },
      "answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Optic nerve atrophy, dry eyes, and blurry vision indicate a Liver problem (The Liver opens into the eyes). Tinnitus, dizziness, and nocturnal emissions suggest a Kidney problem (The Kidneys govern the bones and produce marrow; The Kidneys store essence). The red tongue and thready, weak pulse indicate Yin Deficiency. Therefore, this can be diagnosed as Liver and Kidney Yin Deficiency, where the yin fluids of both the Liver and Kidneys are depleted."

      "explanation": "Wheezing, short and rapid breathing, a weak voice, cough, sweating with activity, a pale tongue, and a weak pulse are all classic symptoms of Lung Qi Deficiency.
